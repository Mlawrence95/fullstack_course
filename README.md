# Udemy Django fullstack course
 
 This repo follows my work through 
 [Jose Portilla's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/) 
 on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, and Django. 
 Each lecture gets its own file or set of files as I walk through its content, with the file name typically
 being essentially the lecture title.
